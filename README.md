## About This Course

This course introduces the basics of Python programming in an easy-to-follow format using Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to help you understand fundamental concepts of Python, including variables, control flow, functions, and data handling.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (part of the Anaconda distribution or installable via `pip`)

No prior programming knowledge is required, although familiarity with basic computer usage will be helpful.

## Installation Guide

### Installing Python

If you donâ€™t have Python installed yet, download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install it via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for an all-in-one setup that includes Jupyter Notebook.

### Setting up Jupyter Notebook

To run Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by running: pip install notebook

```csharp
or use the Anaconda Navigator if using Anaconda.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook with the command:
```

jupyter notebook

```vbnet

## Course Modules

This repository contains several notebooks divided into easy-to-follow modules:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to Python**
Get familiar with Python syntax and basic operations.

2. **Module 2: Variables and Data Types**
Learn how to work with different data types (strings, integers, floats) and variables.

3. **Module 3: Control Flow (If-Else, Loops)**
Understand how to control the flow of your program using conditional statements and loops.

4. **Module 4: Functions and Modules**
Learn to write reusable code with functions and how to organize your Python code into modules.

5. **Module 5: Working with Data (Lists, Dictionaries)**
Explore Python's built-in data structures like lists and dictionaries, and how to manipulate them.

6. **Module 6: Input/Output and File Handling**
Get comfortable working with input from users and reading/writing data to files.
